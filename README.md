# OFPP Contextual Database

The OFPP Contextual Database contains data that place the OFPP family policy coding into a wider socio-economic context of the individual countries. It also provides additional context to the designs of the individual family policies, which cannot be fully captured by the OFPP coding.

The OFPP Contextual Database is a Stata file.

This is a work in progress - more variables will be added in coming updates of the OFPP Contextual Database.
